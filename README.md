# TafIn--Tagger-for-Intensifiers
An implementation with the goal of a model, which can be used for an automatic identification of intensifiers of adjectives in German. This modell is trained on an german corpus, therefore the automatic identification will only be available for the German language so far.

As this is the project of a thesis, there are also baselines within this repository, which were needed for a comparation in the evaluation.  


## Requirements to run the model:
In order for the model to run smoothly there is the need to install the following modules/packets:
* charsplit       0.1     
* joblib          1.1.0   
* numpy           1.23.1  
* pip             21.2.4  
* python-crfsuite 0.9.8   
* regex           2022.7.9
* scikit-learn    1.1.1   
* scipy           1.8.1   
* setuptools      58.1.0  
* sklearn         0.0     
* SoMeWeTa        1.8.0   
* threadpoolctl   3.1.0 
```
